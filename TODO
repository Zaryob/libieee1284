To fix in the API:

- A way of giving a previously-opened file descriptor to the library to
  use as the ppdev device (needed in print filters, for instance).

- expose ieee1284_free_port (deref_port), and add ieee1284_clone().  Apps
  don't care about the port list once they have the right port, so it would
  be convenient for them to be able to snatch a port from the list and free
  the list.

Still to do in the implementation:

- F1284_EXCL for iopl() and /dev/port (use /dev/lp0).  This needs
  configuration file support.

- Default implementations of the block transfer functions, in terms of
  the pins.

- Bounded ECP mode.

- Notice/handle USB printers, at least for device IDs.
