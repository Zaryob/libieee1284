Still to do in the implementation:

- F1284_EXCL for iopl() and /dev/port (use /dev/lp0).  This needs
  configuration file support.

- Default implementations of the block transfer functions, in terms of
  the pins.

- Bounded ECP mode.

- Notice/handle USB printers, at least for device IDs.

- Python bindings
