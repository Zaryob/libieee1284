Currently implemented:

- ieee1284_find_ports works for Linux parallel ports.

- Most access methods are implemented for Linux ppdev, including
  F1284_EXCL support.

- Pin-level access methods are implemented for iopl() and /dev/port.
  F1284_EXCL is not supported yet.

Still to do:

- Default implementation of ECP direction switching functions.

- F1284_EXCL for iopl() and /dev/port (use /dev/lp0).

- Default implementations of the block transfer functions, in terms of
  the pins.
