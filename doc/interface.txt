Still to work out for the interface:

- register access functions need to return an int so that failures
  (i.e. not implemented) can be detected.

- perhaps there needs to be a run-time feature test available for the
  application to see if various classes of functions are to be used or
  not (register access functions again).

- blocking/non-blocking: ieee1284_set_timeout enough?

- need to expose a selectable_fd for /dev/parport0

- need a way for the application to decide which protocol which be
  fastest (with hardware assistance).  PPGETMODES?

- need a way for the application to influence the access method:
  faster (ioperm, ppdev, /dev/port) vs. more secure (ppdev,
  /dev/parport, ioperm).

- there is no error reporting yet

- ieee1284.h needs to define symbolic names for the control/status pins.
